# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?

GPU Computing SIG, also to be referred as GPU SIG.

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?

- Ben van Werkhoven
- Alessio Sclocco

## What is SIG’s mission?

Our mission is to enrich the knowledge of our members in the topic of accelerated computing, with a focus on GPUs, and to do so we organize meetings to discuss recent developments in technology and research.
We focus on technologies and expertise that are required to accelerate scientific computations, specifically by rewriting and optimizing the compute-intensive parts of the code.
There are many currently running projects that require expertise in GPU programming, and also in proposals currently under our calls we see a growing demand for GPU programming expertise at the eScience center.

Furthermore, we maintain close connections with the broad research community by actively participating in national-level workshops, by inviting external speakers at the SIG meetings, and having students present their research projects.
We are also involved in the teaching of GPU programming courses, both nationally and internationally and represent the first contact point for eScience engineers having issues with performance-critical code, which happens regularly.

Finally, the eScience Center GPU programming expertise is internationally recognized, which is e.g. proven by our leading role in European projects such as ESIWACE-2.
To strengthen this position and secure future participation in large HPC collaborations, our skill in optimizing and accelerating scientific applications is essential and the GPU SIG plays a key role in preserving and improving this expertise.

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?

## What is the Office group of the SIG use?

GPU Computing

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2020 - April 2021

We’ve had several presentations from eScience engineers on their projects, where the SIG provides comments and suggestions on the work of the engineers.
In the period between October 2020 and April 2021 we had 7 meetings, including a SIG wide discussion on the projects using GPUs, a report from Gijs on performance portability using DSLs, some project updates, an overview of the use of parallelization in Python for radio astronomy provided by Hanno, and three external speakers.

Alessio has attended yet another GPU Hackathon (Helmholtz 2021) as a mentor to gather experience with running hackathons and workshops.
We plan to organize workshops like these ourselves in the future, where the idea is to invite project partners and others to submit proposals for codes that could use or improve their use of GPUs.
During such a workshop a team of experienced engineers will help the participants with porting and optimizing their GPU codes.

Ben is currently developing material for an instructor-led tutorial on Kernel Tuner, and several members of the GPU SIG, including Hanno and Alessio, are involved in testing and co-developing the material.

Ben and Alessio have taught the SIG's "GPU Programming Course" three times in the aforementioned period: in November (1) for the eScience Center engineers, and in December (2) for the PRACE course on GPU portability organized by SURF and (3) for the ASCI research school.
There is also an ongoing effort to add a GPU programming lesson to the “Software Carpentry” style courses offered by the center, and Alessio and Hanno have been selected to participate in a lesson development workshop organized by the Carpentries.

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2021

- **Every three weeks** regular SIG meetings where eScience engineers, students, and external speakers present a topic
- **May 2021** GPU programming course in the context of the eScience Academy program
- **September 2021** Ben is in the process of proposing a tutorial on Kernel Tuner for the 17th IEEE eScience conference
- We are in contact with Tom to discuss the possibility of organizing a GPU Hackaton in the context of the "Computing Weeks"
- Finishing the first version of the new Carpentry style GPU programming course

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

- More and updated GPU Computing expertise among eScience engineers currently working on eScience projects that require GPU expertise.
- Knowledge sharing between eScience engineers working on different projects.
- A platform for asking feedback and questions to colleagues regarding compute-intensive problems.
- Constructively working together and sharing knowledge with the HPC and ML groups at SURFSara.
- Establishing and maintaining the position of the Netherlands eScience center as a national and international center of excellence in GPU Computing, through teaching courses, creating new and maintaining existing collaborations.
- Keeping our expertise in heterogeneous computing up to date, in a landscape that is rapidly diversifying, with plenty vendor-driven software innovations and emerging computing platforms. Our projects demand both expertise in low-level software engineering as well as down-stream, high-level packages such as tensor flow for ML or domain-specific languages.
