## Which persons will act as SIG Leads?
- Erik Tjong Kim Sang
- Jisk Attema
- Dafne van Kuppevelt

## What is SIGâ€™s mission?
The mission of the Natural Language Processing SIG is to improve the awareness of state-of-the-art relevant natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers and to exchange experiences on the topic

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?
https://github.com/NLeSC/natural-language-processing-sig

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?
eHumanities

There is also a [Microsoft Teams Group](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ac87796efc0b54b8f870bc2fbbd934ca3%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=04716d15-4155-456d-beaa-37d137c57569&tenantId=aa3aeacc-6307-42b2-ac05-787dd5c32574)

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2020 - April 2021 (for existing SIGs)
- **General meetings**:

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2020
<!--  help text goes here  -->
- **Finish course Deep Learning for NLP**: we have one [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z](video lecture) left 
- **Continue general meetings**: with the following activities:
  - Discuss the progress of the running NLeSC NLP projects
  - Watch relevant (online) lectures or presentations
  - Discuss recent paper / tool / methodology

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Improved awareness of natural language processing issues in current eScience projects by increased communication between knowledgeable and interested engineers
- Better chance of solving bottlenecks in these projects thanks to feedback of our team
- Enhanced understanding of recent natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers by presentations/courses of recent developments in the field
