## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?

<!--  Please make sure to have two SIG leads to reduce bus factor.
      SIG leads are allowed to write the hours dedicated to organizing
      SIG activities under the R&D budget. Please mention in the notes the
      name of your SIG:
        Account: 000104
        Project: 020203
        Hour type: 00071

## What is SIG’s mission?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The mission of this SIG is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center, as well as their technical implementations. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2020 - April 2021 (for existing SIGs)

We had the following presentations:

- 2020-11-23: Chapter2-Small Worlds in "A First Course in Network Science"
- 2020-11-09: Voronoi diagrams and their many and varied uses, an introduction
- 2020-10-26: Chapter2-Small Worlds in "A First Course in Network Science"
- 2020-12-07: Extreme value theory in weather & climate
- 2021-02-15: Chapter3-Hubs in "A First Course in Network Science"
- 2021-03-01: Random walks - part I
- 2021-03-15: Chapter4-Directions in "A First Course in Network Science"
- 2021-03-25: SIG lightning talk
- 2021-03-29: Mining gold with Bayesian Optimization
- 2021-04-12: Chapter4 & 5 in "A First Course in Network Science"

The presentations can be found on the
[Analytics SIG GitHub repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG/tree/master/Meetings).

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2021

- **Following a course**: We continue working on the book [A first course in
  network
  science](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-first-course-in-network-science/EE22722F27519D8BB1443C7225C57BAF)
  in presentation formats.
- **Monthly presentations**: Continuing the monthly meetings with 30min
  presentations. We aim for monthly interactive meetings where diverse speakers
  from in and outside the center present a topic. The topic can be either an
  introduction into a technique or an application where advanced analytical
  methods played a pivotal role.
- **Organize small hackathon** We choose a dataset and technique that we want to
  explore and organize a small (1 day?) hackathon.

The planned/upcoming meetings will be posted on
the [Analytics SIG GitHub project page](https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG/projects/1).

We will explore other topics such as:

- Basics of optimization methods e.g. statistics of Machine Learning algorithms
- Data cleaning for AI e.g. filling missing values, and outliers detection
- Numerical computational techniques

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

- Internal training on a specific topic (mentioned above)
- Sharing knowledge on statistics (at basic/intermediate level)
- Transfer of knowledge by inviting external speakers
- Keeping a portfolio of expertise in analytics at the center
- Making a collection of tools and resources
