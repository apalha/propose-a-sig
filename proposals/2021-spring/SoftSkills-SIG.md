* 06/05/2021 Session on cultural awareness by Nicole Kienhuis, an intercultural trainer. We have plans to 
* 27/05/2021 Session on providing and receiving Feedback (II) this time more focusing on RES-oriented tasks, like how to provide/receive feedback via Teams, pull request or article review.


## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?
<!--  Think of internal as well as external dissemination targets -->
Our main focus for the next period is to continue providing a comfortable place for people to share knowledge and experience on Soft Skills. We would like to identify organisation areas linked to soft-skills that might need improvement or training.
