Agile SIG

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?

## What is SIG’s mission?
The mission of the Agile SIG is to introduce, discuss and teach Agile methodologies within the eScience Center.
We want Agile to become common knowledge in the center and aim for engineers/PM/TL/MT/DT/Operations to use it when appropriate.
This will contribute to the team work within the center and to the restructuring and scaling phase we are now entering.
In addition the SIG acts as a platform for the exhange of experiences between the different teams at the center.
We will also connect to other research organizations working in an Agile manner, for instance with invited speakers at the SIG.

## SIG outcomes in the period October 2020 - April 2021 (for existing SIGs)
The Agile SIG has become the discussion platform for how to succesfully apply Agile methods to working at the eScience Center.
Topics discussed in this period include:
      - Architecture and design in Agile.
      - Review meetings – why, who, what? 
      - Lessons learned from working as a Team during the lockdown.
      - Ideal Team composition (specialized vs cross-functional teams, single vs multi-section teams)

Due to the Corona crisis, involvement of external people was postponed.

We are also working on setting up an [Introduction to Agile](https://github.com/escience-academy/lesson-agile-escience) course. This is reaching the beta phase now.

## Plans for the period until the end of October 2021
<!--  help text goes here  -->
In this section, list what plans you have for this SIG. Describe each plan according to the following format:

For the title, describe your plan in just a few words. For the context, describe briefly and concretely what is the plan.
