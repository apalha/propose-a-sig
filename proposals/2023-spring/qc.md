New SIG to start in spring 2023

## Plans for the coming year
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The SIG will have one session every four weeks according to SIG slot 10, starting in March 2023. The following types of sessions are currently being planned:

- **Learn together**: Participants will learn quantum computing together based on curated materials. Based on availability, access to real quantum hardware could be arranged for the participants to explore.
- **Seminars**: Speakers, internal and external, will be invited to present materials related to quantum computing focusing on recent advances and breakthroughs in the field
- **Discussion**: Participants can discuss specific topics and/or projects (ongoing and proposed) with each other aimed at sharing knowledge and ideas in quantum computing.

Our link with quantum application lab will help in identifying and inviting external speakers in the field.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

- Increased expertise in the center for quantum computing.
- Increased visibility of the center's interest/expertise in quantum computing 
- Knowledge transfer from external participants to the center
